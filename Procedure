  In this Portfolio two, we are creating two unprivileged alpine lxc-containers C1,C2 in the raspberry pi. 
We bridge the containers with the host, which is pi, and with each other. 
Also the networking between host and containers, and between containers is enabled. 
Through this procedure we want the two containers to comunicate with each other, and more specifically, 
the C1 container is the one that is open to the web server, and C2 container is the one that sends the script 
that we have created or whatever we want. The result of that script,which shows random numbers, 
we can see it in the C1 container and the web server after we make a request with the ip address through the C1 container. 
If all these are working properly, then we are going to be able to see the results in every device 
that is connected to the same network through the ip address of the host that we provide them.
In order to do this we followed the portfolio two instructure from the google drive 
and some tutorials. 
The 1st is https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html
the second is https://angristan.xyz/setup-network-bridge-lxc-net/
After these tutorials we did manage to have a bridge between the containers and the host and we can ping each other
Also we did manage to show the result of the rng.sh script to C1 container.
We did this with the socat command in the C2 container which is: socat -v -v tcp-listen:8080,fork,reuseaddr exec:/bin/rng.sh
and then from C1 container we just did curl C2:8080 and the random numbers appeared there. It takes a while sometimes but eventually
the numbers are there.
In the web it just appears a webpage from lighttpd server which show us that communicate with the host
but it is not the result that we want.
